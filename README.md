## **1. Introduction**
The purpose of this project is to **implement an AI-driven framework** for **evaluating software business ideas** using advanced **prompt engineering**. The system leverages **multi-phase data collection, dynamic user interactions, memory-based reasoning, and iterative LLM inference.** This document details the **mathematical, algorithmic, and engineering principles** behind our **prompt engineering approach**.

---

## **2. System Overview**
The **LLM-based business feasibility system** follows a **three-phase process**:

1. **Phase 1 - User Input Collection** üìù  
   - Dynamically asks questions, gathers responses, and maintains state across turns.
   - Uses **context-awareness** to prevent redundant queries.

2. **Phase 2 - Internal Analysis** üîç  
   - Processes responses and evaluates **market feasibility**, **technical viability**, and **business strategy**.
   - Uses **mathematical models** to estimate business potential.

3. **Phase 3 - Final Business Evaluation** üìä  
   - Iterates over structured **output templates** to **produce a final decision report**.
   - Implements **iterative execution** of evaluation modules.

## **3. Mathematical Formulation of Prompt Dynamics**
### **3.1 Memory-Based Questioning Model**
Our approach relies on **LLM-based active recall** to prevent redundant questions and **ensure conversational continuity**. This can be represented as follows:

Let:
- \( Q = \{q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n\} \) be the set of all possible **business-related questions**.
- \( A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\} \) be the corresponding **user responses**.
- \( M \) be the **memory function** storing responses.

A function \( f(Q, M) \) determines whether a question should be asked:

\[
f(q_i, M) = 
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if } q_i \notin M \\
0, & \text{if } q_i \in M
\end{cases}
\]

where:
- \( f(q_i, M) = 1 \) **prompts the LLM to ask** \( q_i \).
- \( f(q_i, M) = 0 \) **skips** \( q_i \) if it is already answered.

This ensures that the AI dynamically **recalls past interactions** and **avoids redundant questions**.

---

### **3.2 Phase Execution via Iterative Querying**
Each **analysis phase** is executed iteratively, where each function \( P_x \) (for \( x \) in {1,2,3}) **processes data in a sequential manner**:

\[
P_x(A) = T_x(A) + F_x(A)
\]

where:
- \( T_x(A) \) is the **structured transformation** of user inputs \( A \).
- \( F_x(A) \) is the **LLM function evaluation** for analyzing the business idea.

Each phase is processed **iteratively** as:

\[
\forall x \in \{1,2,3\}, \quad R_x = P_x(A) \quad \text{(where \( R_x \) is the response output)}
\]

Once **Phase 1 completes**, the system **triggers Phases 2 and 3 automatically**.

---

### **3.3 LLM Query Execution with Adaptive Context Window**
To **maintain coherence across interactions**, we use **adaptive memory management** within the LLM‚Äôs **context window** (\( C_t \)):

\[
C_t = \sum_{i=1}^{t} (\lambda_i \cdot A_i)
\]

where:
- \( C_t \) is the context at turn \( t \).
- \( A_i \) are **previous user responses** weighted by **relevance factor** \( \lambda_i \).
- \( \sum \lambda_i = 1 \) ensures that total memory usage is **normalized**.

This **adaptive weighting mechanism** ensures **critical information persists**, while **less relevant past responses decay**.

---

## **4. Implementation Details**
### **4.1 Prompt Construction & Execution**
The system constructs **dynamic prompts** by **combining structured templates** with **real-time user data**. The core prompt passed to the LLM is:

```python
PHASE1_PROMPT = system_prompt + "\n" + SYS_PHASEI
```

Where:
- `system_prompt` defines **the AI‚Äôs role and interaction constraints**.
- `SYS_PHASEI` provides **the structured directive for Phase 1 questioning**.

Each **LLM query execution** follows:

```python
payload = create_payload(
    target="ollama",
    model="llama2:latest",
    prompt=PROMPT,
    temperature=1.0,
    num_ctx=100,
    num_predict=300
)
```

This ensures **consistent inference settings**, allowing the model to process **complex multi-turn interactions**.

---

### **4.2 Iterative Execution of Analysis Templates**
For **Phases 2 & 3**, the system iterates through **predefined analysis templates** dynamically:

```python
queries = [
    ("Phase 2 Analysis Function", "Phase 2 Execution"),
    ("Phase 3 Final Evaluation Function", "Phase 3 Execution")
]

for query, name in queries:
    query_text = system_prompt.format(template_function=query, name=name)
    
    payload = create_payload(
        target="ollama",
        model="llama2:latest",
        prompt=query_text,
        temperature=1.0,
        num_ctx=100,
        num_predict=300
    )
    
    time_taken, response = model_req(payload)
    print(f"Processing {name}...\nAI Response:\n", response)
```

Here:
- The **template function** executes **structured AI analysis modules**.
- Responses are **processed iteratively** to construct a **final business evaluation**.

## **5. Evaluation and Future Enhancements**
### **5.1 Model Performance Metrics**
To **evaluate system performance**, we define the **success rate** \( S \) of business feasibility evaluations:

\[
S = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(B_i)}{n}
\]

where:
- \( B_i \) represents **business evaluations completed**.
- \( f(B_i) = 1 \) if **a valid business recommendation is made**, otherwise **0**.

Future enhancements could include:
1. **Multi-modal input support** (voice, documents).
2. **Graph-based memory augmentation** for better context tracking.
3. **Integration with external business databases** for real-time insights.
