# Research Question 

Entrepreneurs and developers often struggle to determine whether their software ideas are viable businesses before investing time and resources. Traditional business analysis requires expertise and extensive research, making the process inefficient and prone to bias. The goal is to use LLMs and prompt engineering to automate and streamline requirement analysis, enabling users to determine if their software app ideas are worth pursuing as viable businesses..

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

* I am a full stack developer and engineer who has worked in generative ai for the past four years focusing on ai driven automation prompt engineering and business intelligence applications  
* I have firsthand experience witnessing how businesses especially startups fail due to poor market validation lack of technical feasibility assessments and misguided product assumptions  
* I have several startup ideas and concepts that i want to validate using ai driven business analysis to determine their viability before investing time and resources  
* I have extensively researched and tested various prompt engineering techniques including chain of thought react and self reflection prompting to enhance structured decision making in ai models 

#### What this research is exploring

<!-- Free-format; use the topics that are applicable to your exploration  -->

* we employ iterative ai driven business evaluation techniques including multi step hybrid prompting to guide structured requirement analysis and decision making  
* we are building a dynamic ai assisted system that validates software business ideas by analyzing market demand technical feasibility competition and financial risk factors  
* we are exploring the effectiveness of structured interactive llm driven business evaluations to improve accuracy in market analysis and reduce bias in business decision making 

#### Implications for practice

<!-- Free-format; use the topics that are applicable to your exploration  -->

* it will be easier to validate software startup ideas before committing significant time and resources reducing the risk of failure  
* it will optimize business requirement gathering and feasibility analysis making it more data driven and structured rather than intuition based  
* we will better understand how ai can assist entrepreneurs in making informed decisions by simulating the reasoning process of business analysts and investors  
* this research can demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid prompt engineering techniques in generating structured real world business evaluations  
* ...

# Research Method

the research process involves designing testing and iterating different ai driven business evaluation techniques using prompt engineering three different experiments were conducted folowing:

- Baseline prompt simple direct questioning the model was given a straightforward prompt asking users to describe their business idea this test was used to establish a baseline for user input quality and model response structure  

- Structured evaluation prompt a guided assessment structure was introduced where the model collected specific business details and applied some basic feasibility checks based on predefined logic  

- Advanced multi step hybrid prompt the final experiment involved an iterative dynamic prompting technique where the ai model actively injected different sections of a structured business evaluation report over the course of the analysis refining results based on user responses  

each experiment was logged and analyzed to determine which approach provided the most actionable insights and how effectively the ai adapted to complex business evaluation tasks  

<!-- WHEN APPLICABLE AND AVAILABLE -->

# Results

the advanced multi step hybrid prompt outperformed the other methods by providing the most structured actionable and realistic business evaluation the model successfully  

* collected and validated user input iteratively ensuring that incomplete or vague responses were refined  
* assessed market viability competition and technical feasibility dynamically injecting analysis segments progressively rather than relying on static response formats  
* generated a detailed feasibility report including risk assessments investment readiness scores and potential business model pivots  
* reduced bias and assumption driven conclusions prompting users to clarify uncertainties and validate their assumptions through structured questioning  
* produced highly accurate revenue projections and cost risk assessments making it practical for real world startup validation  

# Further research

* expanding the ai modelâ€™s ability to integrate real time market data into business feasibility assessments for more accurate projections. Also get user feedback from the tools usage.  
* testing different ai assisted decision making techniques such as self reflection loops or graph of thought reasoning to enhance business validation.  
* developing a more interactive business evaluation workflow where the ai continuously refines its assessment based on real time financial and market shifts.

#### Implications for practice  


# Research Method  



# Results  


the baseline prompt failed to provide meaningful analysis as responses were inconsistent and lacked depth the structured evaluation prompt improved accuracy but lacked adaptability and interactive refinement making it only moderately effective  

# Further research  

 

this research demonstrates that ai driven structured business evaluation using hybrid prompt engineering techniques is a viable method for reducing startup failure risks and improving decision making accuracy future work will focus on enhancing automation data integration and deeper investment analysis features to improve reliability and scalability
