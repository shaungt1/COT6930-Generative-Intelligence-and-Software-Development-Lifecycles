    "# Advanced Hybrid Prompting for Business Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This advanced hybrid prompting method enables an AI assistant to systematically evaluate software business ideas through **iterative user interaction** and **structured analysis**. The model follows a three-phase approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1 - Data Collection:** The AI gathers all necessary user-provided information by asking targeted questions sequentially. Each response is stored and recalled to avoid redundancy.\n",
    "2. **Phase 2 - Internal Processing:** The AI processes all collected data without external interaction, applying structured business evaluation techniques, including market analysis, feasibility assessment, and risk identification.\n",
    "3. **Phase 3 - Final Report Generation:** The AI synthesizes all findings into a comprehensive **business viability report**, detailing market relevance, technical feasibility, financial projections, and strategic recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hybrid approach allows for **dynamic refinement**, meaning the AI injects structured evaluation sections progressively, refining insights based on user responses before generating the final verdict. This ensures **higher accuracy**, **minimized information gaps**, and **actionable business insights** compared to traditional static prompting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt employs **Dynamic Reasoning with Augmented Action and Memory (DRAAM)**, integrating **iterative questioning, real-time memory recall, structured inference, and logical evaluation** to assess software business ideas. It follows a **three-phase methodology**, beginning with **context-aware user input collection**, ensuring only relevant questions are asked dynamically. The system then moves into **iterative analysis**, where structured sections use **pattern-based reasoning, market comparisons, and hypothesis-driven assessments** to determine feasibility, scalability, and market potential. The final phase compiles all insights into a **comprehensive evaluation report**, leveraging **computed TAM, SAM, and SOM** metrics, risk assessments, and business viability scoring. The methodology ensures **adaptive, real-world feasibility analysis** while maintaining a **concise, structured approach**, dynamically adjusting responses based on the user's input and previous interactions."

Your goal is to determine whether a software business idea is viable. Start by gathering essential details from the user in a single interaction. Ask the user to describe their business idea, including the problem it solves, the uniqueness of the solution, the target audience, and the planned revenue model. Capture their full response before analyzing. Then, assess the clarity of their input, identifying any missing or ambiguous details such as market demand, competition, or scalability.

What problem does it solve, and how is it different from existing solutions? Who is your target audience, and how do you plan to make money from it?\"\\n\\nSteps to Implement and Test:\\n\\n- Present this broad, open-ended prompt to users without additional structure.\\n- Capture their responses and assess completeness, clarity, and relevance.\\n- Identify missing or ambiguous details, such as unclear market focus or weak differentiation.\\n- Log responses and analyze whether users struggle to provide critical details without guidance.\\n- Use these results to compare against structured questioning methods.\\n\\nGuidlines:\\nAnalyze the following business idea by identifying its core problem, proposed solution, and market relevance. Extract the problem significance based on user input and determine if there is a clear market demand. Assess whether the proposed solution introduces meaningful differentiation or novelty. If competitor data is available, evaluate how existing solutions address this problem and whether the new concept has a competitive edge. Provide an initial feasibility rating based on these factors, ensuring the assessment remains grounded in explicit user-provided information rather than assumptions.
