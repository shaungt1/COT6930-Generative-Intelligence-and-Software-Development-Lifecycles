    "# Advanced Hybrid Prompting for Business Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This advanced hybrid prompting method enables an AI assistant to systematically evaluate software business ideas through **iterative user interaction** and **structured analysis**. The model follows a three-phase approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1 - Data Collection:** The AI gathers all necessary user-provided information by asking targeted questions sequentially. Each response is stored and recalled to avoid redundancy.\n",
    "2. **Phase 2 - Internal Processing:** The AI processes all collected data without external interaction, applying structured business evaluation techniques, including market analysis, feasibility assessment, and risk identification.\n",
    "3. **Phase 3 - Final Report Generation:** The AI synthesizes all findings into a comprehensive **business viability report**, detailing market relevance, technical feasibility, financial projections, and strategic recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hybrid approach allows for **dynamic refinement**, meaning the AI injects structured evaluation sections progressively, refining insights based on user responses before generating the final verdict. This ensures **higher accuracy**, **minimized information gaps**, and **actionable business insights** compared to traditional static prompting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt employs **Dynamic Reasoning with Augmented Action and Memory (DRAAM)**, integrating **iterative questioning, real-time memory recall, structured inference, and logical evaluation** to assess software business ideas. It follows a **three-phase methodology**, beginning with **context-aware user input collection**, ensuring only relevant questions are asked dynamically. The system then moves into **iterative analysis**, where structured sections use **pattern-based reasoning, market comparisons, and hypothesis-driven assessments** to determine feasibility, scalability, and market potential. The final phase compiles all insights into a **comprehensive evaluation report**, leveraging **computed TAM, SAM, and SOM** metrics, risk assessments, and business viability scoring. The methodology ensures **adaptive, real-world feasibility analysis** while maintaining a **concise, structured approach**, dynamically adjusting responses based on the user's input and previous interactions."

From what I understand, it\\'s part of a larger project, maybe related to product development or market strategy. The user mentioned unique value proposition (UVP) and strategic focus areas, so perhaps this is an evaluation process for different sections or aspects of a product.\\\\n\\\\nThe initial response laid out a step-by-step method: Define objectives, review existing docs, create hypotheses, evaluate UVP, prioritize, validate assumptions, summarize. It also provided specific questions for each part. So, to analyze further, I should probably think about how these steps can be applied in real situations and what common pitfalls might exist.\\\\n\\\\nLet me start by considering a hypothetical scenario where a company is trying to launch a new product. They have several ideas on the table, but they need to figure out which one has the highest potential for success. The process described seems like a solid approach, but I want to make sure I understand each step thoroughly and see if there\\'s anything missing or that could be improved.\\\\n\\\\nStep 1: Define clear objectives and criteria for evaluating ideas. Okay, so the company needs to have a clear understanding of what they\\'re looking for in their next product or service. Without well-defined objectives, it might be challenging to evaluate which ideas are good. The criteria should probably include things like profitability, feasibility, market demand, etc. I wonder if they\\'ve considered how each criterion will impact\", \"<think>\\\\nOkay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to approach this problem. The user mentioned something about competitor revenue divided by total market revenue times 100. That sounds like a market share calculation. They also noted whether it\\'s significant or not based on the percentage. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. It seems like they\\'re looking for guidance on calculating and evaluating market shares of competitors in a given market. Maybe they want to know how to determine if one competitor is dominant or emerging.\\\\n\\\\nI should outline the steps involved in calculating market share. That would involve determining the total revenue in the market, identifying each company\\'s revenue, calculating their percentages, and then analyzing those numbers to assess competitiveness. \\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, it might be useful to explain why understanding market share is important—like how it helps businesses make strategic decisions or identify gaps in the market.\\\\n\\\\nMaybe include examples or scenarios where a company could use this information, like adjusting their pricing strategy or targeting specific demographics more effectively.\\\\n\\\\nAlright, let me organize my thoughts and put together a clear explanation on calculating and understanding market share.\\\\n</think>\\\\n\\\\n**Understanding Market Share: A Step-by-Step Explanation**\\\\n\\\\nMarket share is a critical concept in business that helps companies understand their position within an industry. It reflects the proportion of sales or revenue a company holds relative to its competitors. Calculating and analyzing market share can provide insights into a company\\'s competitiveness, customer preferences, and growth opportunities.\\\\n\\\\n**1. Understanding Market Share**\", \\'<think>\\\\nOkay, so I\\\\\\'m trying to understand this statement about risk scores and resource availability indicating a strong foundation. The brackets mention [clear/uncertain] as determined by things like technical solutions and feasibility studies. Hmm.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, what does \"risk score\" mean here? Maybe it refers to some measure of how risky the project or situation is. High risk could mean more uncertainty or potential problems. Then, resource availability—do they have enough people, money, etc., to handle whatever comes up.\\\\n\\\\nThe user also mentions a \"systemic approach\" and \"stakeholder mapping.\" Stakeholder mapping is a method used in project management to identify all the individuals, groups, or organizations that have an interest in the outcome of a project. A systemic approach means looking at how different parts of a system interact with each other.\\\\n\\\\nIn the context of ERM (Enterprise Risk Management), a systemic risk refers to risks that can affect multiple areas of the organization simultaneously. These are often known as \"systemic\" because they can propagate through the entire system, potentially causing significant disruptions.\\\\n\\\\nA \"Black Swan\" event is an unknown, low-probability event with severe consequences. They\\\\\\'re considered extreme in terms of their impact on the status quo and are often beyond normal forecast scenarios.\\\\n\\\\nThe term \"tail risk\" refers to the high probability of small losses (or gains) that combine over time to result in a significant loss (or gain) overall. It\\\\\\'s sometimes called \"the 1%\\', \\'<think>\\\\nAlright, let\\\\\\'s break this down. The user provided some information involving \"SOM\" and \"market_trend_drivers.\" They mentioned that the evaluation is based on projected revenue potential, scalability, and long-term growth. Then they included a chunk of text in Chinese, which I need to understand.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, \"SOM\" likely stands for System of Measurement or something similar, but without more context, it\\\\\\'s hard to say exactly. Maybe it\\\\\\'s an internal term specific to the project or company. The text in Chinese seems to be about setting up a quality management system that complies with international standards like ISO 9001.\\\\n\\\\nThe part about traceability is important because it ensures each step in the process can be traced back, which helps in identifying defects and maintaining quality control. Also, continuous improvement through corrective actions based on feedback would help in maintaining high product standards over time.\\\\n\\\\nTo effectively implement this, leadership needs to commit by providing necessary resources, training, and support. This includes setting clear goals for the QMS, assigning responsibilities, and monitoring progress through regular audits and reviews.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s important that everyone in the organization is aware of their role in the QMS and understands how their work contributes to overall quality. Training and communication will be key in ensuring that the system is effectively implemented.\\\\n\\\\nI think this covers most aspects of establishing a Quality Management System. But I\\\\\\'m wondering if there are other elements or considerations I might have missed, such as specific tools or software that can\\', \"<think>\\\\nAlright, so I\\'m trying to understand this likelihood of adoption scale that someone mentioned. It seems like they\\'re using a percentage-based system to categorize whether something will be adopted or not. The categories are:\\\\n\\\\n- ≥70% = likely to be adopted\\\\n- 40-69% = uncertain\\\\n- ≤39% = unlikely to be adopted\\\\n\\\\nHmm, I\\'m wondering why they chose these specific percentages. Maybe it\\'s based on some statistical significance or previous studies? Or perhaps it\\'s just a way to categorize things simply.\\\\n\\\\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have a new product that people might adopt. If 60% of people show interest, that\\'s above 40%, so it would be categorized as something to invest in. But if only 20% are interested, then maybe it\\'s not worth pursuing? Hmm, but I guess the cut-off could change based on the context.\\\\n\\\\nWait, but the problem statement didn\\'t specify what we\\'re categorizing. So maybe I\\'m supposed to figure that out through examples or reasoning. Let me try a different approach.\\\\n\\\\nMaybe instead of thinking about it in terms of percentages, I should look at the numbers themselves. For instance, if the value is between 0 and 1, it\\'s considered low. If it\\'s between 1 and 10, medium, and above 10, high. That could be a way to categorize things like risk levels or scores.\\\\n\\\\nBut then again, sometimes you\", \\'<think>\\\\nOkay, so I\\\\\\'m trying to understand what this \"Iterative Section Analysis\" in EO Phase 3 means. The user mentioned it\\\\\\'s part of the risk assessment process, particularly focusing on the high-risk factor and market shifts. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, I think \"Iterative\" means it\\\\\\'s a repeating or cyclical process. So, maybe they mean you go through sections multiple times until something is resolved or clarified. But I\\\\\\'m not entirely sure.\\\\n\\\\nNext, \"Section Analysis\"—probably breaking down a part of a larger topic into smaller pieces to understand each part better. Maybe like dissecting a problem into its components before tackling the whole thing.\\\\n\\\\nI wonder how this applies in a project management context. Maybe they\\\\\\'re talking about analyzing tasks or team roles within a project? Or perhaps it\\\\\\'s about planning phases, breaking down objectives into manageable steps.\\\\n\\\\nBut I\\\\\\'m not entirely sure. Maybe they meant something different. Should I ask for clarification? Yeah, that would make sense. I need more information to understand how to approach this effectively.\\\\n</think>\\\\n\\\\nIt seems like your message got cut off or wasn\\\\\\'t fully explained. If you could provide a bit more context or clarify your question, I\\\\\\'d be happy to help!\\', \"<think>\\\\nOkay, so I\\'m trying to understand this EO Phase 3 iterative section analysis thing.

      "Alright, starting with Readiness for Investors. The plan seems solid with a clear vision and mission, good market analysis, and a viable product. But it's still in the early stages—maybe like a startup. So I'd say it's somewhat ready but not quite there yet.\n",

      "Next, Financial Projection. They've projected revenues over three years, which is good. However, their numbers are a bit optimistic without supporting details like costs or how they'll get those customers. So I'm hesitant to fully commit based on this alone.\n",

      "Market Opportunity: The target market seems defined, but expanding beyond that could be tricky. There's potential, especially if they can tap into other regions or demographics.\n",

      "Business Model: Their revenue streams are clear—subscription and product sales. But without a detailed plan on how they'll acquire customers, it's hard to see this succeeding as is.\n",

      "Team: They have the right skills, but I'm not sure about their experience in scaling up. More experienced people might be needed for growth.\n",

      "Marketing & Sales Strategy: Their approach is solid with content and SEO, but without a concrete plan on how they'll reach broader audiences, it's uncertain.\n",
